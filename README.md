## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background-image: linear-gradient(hsl(178, 100%, 50%, 0.3), hsl(178, 100%, 50%, 0.3)), url('./images/icon-view.svg') , url('./images/image-equilibrium.jpg');
}
```
### Continued development
I plan to use CSS variables for colors, and also find a better way to center the items

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for background image. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [CSS tricks](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand flexbox module. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
